## **Ignore the date shown for this release. These are the latest builds.**

Extract the zip file into your game folder.

If you're **NOT USING VR**, do **NOT** extract any file other than dinput8.dll into your game folder, or your game may become unstable, and you will lose any form of anti-aliasing.

If you want builds that work on the old non-RT versions, download the versions that have "TDB" in them.
